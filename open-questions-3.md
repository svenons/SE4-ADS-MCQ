## ðŸ§  Open Question 1 â€“ Recursion (10 points)

**Problem: Digit Sum**

Write a recursive function that computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`.

### Example:
Input: `n = 493`  
Output: `16` (4 + 9 + 3)

### Requirements:
- Use recursion.
- Clearly define the base and recursive cases.
- Explain how your function works.
- What is the time complexity with respect to the number of digits?

## ðŸŒ³ Open Question 2 â€“ Binary Tree Tasks (15 points)

You are given a binary tree where each node contains an integer value:

```
        9
       / \
      3   11
         /  \
        10   15
```

### Tasks:
1. Write a function that returns the **maximum value** in the tree.
2. Write a function to check if the tree is a **valid Binary Search Tree**.
3. Write a recursive function that **sums all leaf node values**.
4. Briefly explain what would change in your traversal functions if the tree were a general (non-binary) tree.

## ðŸ”— Open Question 3 â€“ Graph Problem (15 points)

You are given a **directed weighted graph**:

```
Vertices: A, B, C, D  
Edges: Aâ†’B (4), Aâ†’C (2), Bâ†’D (5), Câ†’B (1), Câ†’D (8)
```

### Tasks:
1. Draw the graph or describe its adjacency list with weights.
2. Trace Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm starting from A. Show the shortest distances to each node.
3. Write pseudocode for Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm using a priority queue.
4. If edge Câ†’D had weight -2 instead, would Dijkstra still work? Explain.

## ðŸ”§ Open Question 4 â€“ Pseudocode Modification (10 points)

You are given pseudocode for a function that checks if a number is prime:

"""
function IsPrime(n):
    if n â‰¤ 1: return false
    for i from 2 to nâˆ’1:
        if n mod i == 0:
            return false
    return true
"""

### Tasks:
1. Modify the function to **reduce the time complexity** (e.g., avoid unnecessary checks).
2. Explain what change you made and why it improves performance.
3. What is the new time complexity?
